How do you set up an https connection with Express?
    Are https and ssl the same?
        * https uses ssl or tls to secure traffic
        https://www.instantssl.com/ssl-certificate-products/https.html

    You need a certificate.
        * buy one from a CA (certificate authority)
        * create a self-signed
        https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-certificate-self

          server.csr - BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST
        + server.key - private key
          ______________________________________
          server.crt - site certificate

    Now that you have a cert, set up Express to use it.

        * red: https://localhost


        find where the server is created (/bin/www in Express 4)
        add a secure server
            http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#app.listen
            * options http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11744975/enabling-https-on-express-js

            var privateKey  = fs.readFileSync('sslcert/server.key', 'utf8');
            var certificate = fs.readFileSync('sslcert/server.crt', 'utf8');

        restart the server
            ports under 1024 (including https 443) will require sudo
                http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9164915/node-js-eacces-error-when-listening-on-most-ports


        * load again https://localhost
            * browser will complain because you're using a self-signed cert, proceed anyway

            bypass this with creating your own authority certificate

                This is a big pain in the ass and the cert may not even work.  Just ignore it in the browser.

                openssl x509 -req -days 730 -in server.csr -CA server.crt -CAkey server.key -set_serial 01 -out ia.crt

                openssl pkcs12 -export -out ia.p12 -inkey server.key -in server.crt -chain -CAfile server.crt
